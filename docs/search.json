It states that agents‚Äô expectations about the future value of an economic variable are not systematically wrong. In other words, agents‚Äô expectations are not biased.\nSuppose a representative agent has a constant relative risk aversion utility function:\n\\[\nU =\\sum_{t=0}^{n} \\beta^{t}\n\\\\ u(C_t) =\\sum_{t=0}^{n} \\beta^t \\frac{C_t^{\\gamma} - 1}{\\gamma}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\beta \\ge 0\\) is the discount factor and \\(\\gamma \\ge 0\\) is the coefficient of relative risk aversion.\\(\\mu(\\cdot )\\) is the agent‚Äôs utility function in each time period.\\(C_t\\) is consumption in period \\(t\\).\nSo, obviously the agent‚Äôs optimization problem is: choosing a sequence of consumption \\(\\{C_t\\}_{t=0}^{\\infty}\\) to maximize the expected utility \\[\n\\max_{\\{ C_t \\}} E(u)\n\\] subject to the budget constraint:\n\\[\nC_t + P_t q_t \\le W_t + P_t q_{t-1}\n\\]\nwhere \\(P_t\\) is the price of the consumption good in period \\(t\\), \\(q_t\\) is the quantity of the asset held at the end of period \\(t\\), and \\(W_t\\) is the wage income in period \\(t\\).\nSo we can define this marginal rate of intertemporal substitution (MRIS) as: \\[\nMRS_{t+1}(\\theta) = \\frac { \\frac { \\partial u ( C _ { t + 1 } ) } { \\partial C _ { t + 1 } } } {\\frac { \\partial u ( C _ { t } ) } { \\partial C _ { t } } } = (\\frac{C_{t+1}}{C_t})^{\\gamma-1}\n\\]\nwhere model parameter vector \\(\\theta = (\\beta,\\gamma)^{'}\\).\nSo the First order condition is: \\[\nE[\\beta MRS_{t+1}(\\theta)R_{t+1}|I_t] = 1\n\\]\nwhere \\(R_{t+1}\\) is the gross return on the asset in period \\(t+1\\) and \\(I_t\\) is the information set available at the beginning of period \\(t\\).And the FOC is usually called the Euler equation.And we can estimate this model by using the generalized method of moments (GMM) method.\n\n4.1.1 Production Function and Hypothsis on constant returns to scale\nProduction functionÔºö \\[\nY_t = \\exp(\\epsilon_t)F(L_t,K_t)\n\\]\nwhere \\(Y_t\\) is the output,\\(L_t\\) is the labor input,\\(K_t\\) is the capital input,\\(\\epsilon_t\\) is the random error term.\nSo we can get the constant return to scale hypothesis:\n\\[\n\\lambda F(L_i,K_i) = F(\\lambda L_i,\\lambda K_i) \\text{ for all } \\lambda &gt; 0\n\\]\nCRS is a necessary condition for the existence of a long-run equilibrium in a competitive market.If CRS does not hold, and the technology displays the increasing returns to scale, then the market will lead to natural monopoly.\nIn practical, a conventional approach to estimate the production function is to use the Cobb-Douglas production function: \\[\nY_i = F(L_i,k_i) = A \\exp(\\epsilon_i) L_i^{\\alpha}K_i^{\\beta}\n\\]\nThen CRS becomes a mathematical restriction on the parameters \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\): \\[\\mathbb{H}_0 : \\alpha + \\beta  = 1\\]\nSo if \\(\\alpha + \\beta &gt; 1\\), the production function displays increasing returns to scale; if \\(\\alpha + \\beta &lt; 1\\), the production function displays decreasing returns to scale.\nIn statistics, we can use the F-test to test the null hypothesis \\(\\mathbb{H}_0\\) (one dimensional restriction).\nunfortunately, this test is not suitable for many cross-sectional economic data, which usually display conditional heteroskedasticity.One needs to use a robust, heteroskedasticity-consistent test procedure, such as the White test."

The goal of econometrics and statistics is to find a probability function that most accurately describes the underlying DGP. This probability function is usually called the true probability function or true probability distribution model.\n\n\n\n‚úÖSo how to interpret the probability target to an event?\n\n2.4.1 Approach 1:Relative frequency interpretation\nThe probability of an event can be viewed as the limit of the ‚Äù relative frequency‚Äù of occurrence of the event in a large number of repeated independent experiments under essentially the same conditions.\nThe relative frequency interpretation is valid under the assumption of a large number of repeated experiments under the same condition. In statistics, such an assumption is formally termed as ‚Äúindependence and identical distribution (IID)‚Äù.\n\n‚ÅâÔ∏è When the weather forecast bureau predicts that there is a 30% chance for raining, it means that under the same weather conditions it will rain 30% of the times. We cannot guarantee what will happen on any particular occasion, but if we keep records over a long period of time, we should find that the proportion of ‚Äúraining‚Äù is very close to 0.30 for the days with the same weather condition.\nBut in practical applications, we cannot repeat the same experiment a large number of times under the same conditions. Therefore, the relative frequency interpretation is not very useful in practice. We introduce the subjective interpretation of probability.\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Approach 2:Subjective Probability interpretation\nThe subjective method views probability as a belief in the chance of an event occurring.But a personal or subjective assessment is made of theprobability of an event which is difficult or impossible to estimate in any way.So is that means the subjective probability is not useful?\nüå∞: Subjective probability is the foundation of Bayesian statistics, which is a rival to classical statistics.\nüå∞: Rational Expectations\nRational expectations (Muth 1961) hypothesizes that the subjective expectation of an economic agent (i.e., the expectation under the subjective probability belief of the economic agent) coincides with the mathematical expectation (i.e., the expectation under the objective probability distribution).\nFor example, we eager to have a wage \\(S\\), but we don‚Äôt know the exact value of \\(S\\). We can only estimate the probability distribution of \\(S\\) based on our subjective probability belief. The rational expectation hypothesis states that the subjective expectation of \\(S\\) is equal to the mathematical expectation of wage :the \\(E(S)\\).\nüå∞: Professional Forecast\nThe U.S. central bank‚ÄîFed issues professional forecasts for important macroeconomic indicators such as GDP growth rate, inflation rate and unemployment rate.\nIn each quarter, they send surveys to professional forecasters, asking their views on probability distributions of these important macroeconomic indicators.\nSpecifically, each forecaster will be asked what is his/her forecast of the probability that the inflation rate lies in various intervals.\nüå∞: Risk Neutral Probability\nDuring the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis, many investors were very concerned with the collapse of the Hong Kong peg exchange rate system with U.S. dollars and devaluations of Hong Kong dollars.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn other words, their subjective probabilities of Hong Kong dollar devaluation were higher than the objective probabilities of the Hong Kong dollar movements. The former are called risk-neutral probability distributions and the latter are called objective or physical probability distributions in finance.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gap between these two distributions reflects the risk attitude of market investors. The risk-neutral probability distribution is a financial instrument in derivative pricing.\n\n\n\n\n\n[üí¨ Definition 12.

From the company‚Äôs historical consumer database, it is known that 25% of its customers are high risk, 25% are medium risk, and 50% are low risk. Also, the database shows that the probability that a customer has at least one speeding ticket in one year is 0.25 for high risk, 0.16 for medium risk, and 0.10 for low risk.\nNow suppose a new customer wants to be insured and reports that he has had one speeding ticket this year. What is the probability that he is a high risk customer, given that he has had one speeding ticket this year?"

Independence] Two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent if and only if \\(P(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(B)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndifference between mutally exclusive and independence\n\n\n\nmutually exclusive means the \\(P(A\\cap b) \\equiv 0\\) , the occrance of event \\(A\\) means the disappear of event \\(B\\) , but the independence means \\(P(A\\cap b) \\equiv P(A)P(B)\\).Independence is a probability notion to describe nonexistence of any kind of relationship between two events. It plays a fundamental role in probability theory and statistics. But two independent event may occur at the same time.\n\n\n\nSuppose \\(P(B)&gt;0\\).They by definition of independence:\n\\[\nP(A|B) = P(A \\cap B)\n= \\frac{P(A)P(B)}{P(B) }\n= P(A)\n\\]\nthis formula shows that the conditional probability of \\(A\\) given \\(B\\) equal to the unconditional probability of \\(A\\).The knowledge of \\(B\\) does not help in predicting \\(A\\).Similarly, we have \\(P(B|A) = P(B)\\), i.e.¬†the occurrence of \\(A\\) has no effect on the occurrence or probability of \\(B\\).Intuitively, independence implies that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are ‚Äúirrelevant‚Äù, or there exists no relationship between them.\nüå∞:Random Walk hypothesis(Fama 1970) A stock Price \\(P_t\\) will follow a random walk if \\[\nP_t = P_{t-1} + X_t\n\\]\nwhere the \\(\\{ X_t \\}\\) is the independent across different time period.\n\nNote that here the \\(X_t = P_t - P_{t-1}\\) is the stock price change from the \\(t-1\\) to time \\(t\\)\n\nNow we have a closely related concept : the geometric random walk.The stock price \\(\\{ P_t \\}\\) is called a geoemtric random walk if \\[\n\\ln P_t = \\ln P_{t-1} + X_t\n\\]\n\\(\\{ X_t \\}\\) is independent across different time period.\nThe increment of the geometric random walk is \\[\nX_t = \\ln (\\frac{P_t}{P_{t-1} })\n= \\ln (1 + \\frac{P_t - P_{t-1} }{P_{t-1} })\n\\simeq \\frac{P_t - P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}}\n\\]\ncan be interpreted as the relative stock price change.In long term time series analysis, the geometric random walk is more popular than the random walk because the relative stock price change is more stable than the absolute stock price change.\n‚öñÔ∏è Theorem 13  Let \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are two independent events. Then\n\n\\(A\\) and Bc are independent\n\\(A^{c}\\) and \\(B\\) are independent\n\\(A^{c}\\) and \\(B^{c}\\) are independent\n\n[üí¨ Definition 15 Independence Among Several Events] \\(k\\) events \\(A_1,A_2, \\ldots ,A_n\\) are mutually independent if, for every possible subset \\(A_{i_1}, \\ldots ,A_{i_j}\\) of \\(j\\) of those events \\((j =2,3, \\ldots ,k)\\), \\[\nP(A_{i_1} \\cap \\cdots \\cap A_{i_j}) = P(A_{i_1}) \\times \\cdots \\times P(A_{i_j})\n\\]\n\nFor three or more events, independence is called mutual independence or joint independence. If there is no possibility of misunderstanding, independence is often used without the modifier ‚Äúmutual‚Äù or ‚Äújoint‚Äù when considering several events. \n\nüå∞: Three events \\(A,B\\)and \\(C\\) are independent, if the following \\(2^{3} - (1+3) = 4\\) conditions are satisfied (\\(1 \\text{means the } \\emptyset \\text{ and the} 3 \\text{means the single element set}\\)):\n\n\\(P(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(B)\\)\n\\(P(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(C)\\)\n\\(P(B \\cap C) = P(B)P(C)\\)\n\\(P(A \\cap B \\cap C ) = P(A)P(B)P(C)\\)\n\nüå∞: Complementarity Between Economic Reforms\nIn the fields of economic growth and development, many studies find that one economic policy usually necessities another policy to stimulate the economic growth, which is called policy complementarities. In traditional economics, individual reforms or sequential reforms may not be effective or fully effective, or even back-ring. Reforms must be packed together in order to be effective. Foundation of Probability Theory Independence\nFor example, in order to improve firm productivity (\\(A_1\\)), changing a manager (\\(A_2\\)) should be together with granting autonomy to the firm (\\(A_3\\)).\n\nThere are many other examples of economic complementarities. Harrison (1996), Ro-driguez and Rodrik (2000), Loayza et al.¬†(2005), Chang et al.¬†(2005) document that international trade openness, only when combined with other policies that improve a country‚Äôs educational investment, financial depth, inflation stabilization, public infrastructure, governance, labor market flexibility, and ease of firm entry and exit, can promote economic growth."
